## 💡 Final Notes

1. **Original Dashboard Preserved:** Your existing `Dashboard.jsx` is kept intact. The new implementation is in `EnhancedDashboard.jsx` and is used in the routing.

2. **Backward Compatible:** All existing functionality (authentication, shop connection, affiliate stats) remains unchanged and working.

3. **Easy Migration:** To use the old dashboard, simply change the import in `App.jsx` from `EnhancedDashboard` back to `Dashboard`.

4. **Mock Data Flexibility:** All mock data is centralized in `/src/data/mockData.js` for easy modification.

5. **Extensible:** Every component is designed to be extended with real API calls when ready.
